## About

#### Hello. My name is Sergey Lysenko. I'm a web developer from Ukraine.

I've been working since 2008 and became a professional in website creation and support. In my daily life I'm using such technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Less/Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Ajax, Grunt, Git, different API's, Wordpress etc.
