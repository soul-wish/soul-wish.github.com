Some stuff I use on regular basis while working remotely as a front-end developer.

### Hardware

- MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)
    - Processor: 2,2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7
    - Memory: 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4
    - Graphics: Radeon Pro 555X 4 GB, Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB
- Magic Trackpad 2
- Logitech K380 wireless keyboard
- iPhone X (256 GB)

### Software

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – is a living room for all my code. You can find my personal settings [here](https://github.com/soul-wish/dotfiles).
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) - is my primary browser right now. Using it as a replacement for Google Chrome but with better security and privacy.
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) – a good replacement for default MacOS Terminal.app. I am using Zsh shell and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with a [bunch of plugins](https://github.com/soul-wish/dotfiles/blob/master/.hyper.js).
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) – for slightly increasing my productivity by automating some routine tasks.
- [Focus](https://heyfocus.com/) – to boost my productivity by blocking access to some websites and apps. I wrote about it [here](/productivity-and-focus).
- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) – is my main email client (for MacOS and iOS).
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) – for communicating with my teammates.
